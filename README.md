QuazarGems is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to collect gems in the world. Each gem can be collected once per player, and afterwards it becomes available for other users to collect as well.

⚡ Main Features

Unique gem system for each player in the world.

Position markers to easily locate gems.

Player and world statistics:

Player points

Total points in the world

Number of gems in the world

🛠 Available Commands
Command	Description
/create	Allows the creation of a new gem in the world
/list	Shows all existing gems and allows teleporting to them
/reset	Resets the gems collected by a player
/reset_all	Resets all player statistics, compatible with QuazarBalloons, QuazarTreasures, and QuazarPortals
⚙️ Configuration File

🎯 How It Works

A player finds a gem and collects it.

The gem is registered as “collected” for that player but remains available for other players.

Commands and configuration allow easy management of gems and statistics.
